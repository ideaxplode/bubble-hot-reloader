# Bubble Hot Reloader

Automatically reloads your Bubble app's Preview tab whenever you make a change in the Bubble Editor. No need for manual reloads!

NOTE: This is a Chrome extension.

## Description

**Bubble Hot Reloader** eases your development experience using [Bubble.io](https://bubble.io) by automatically reloading your Preview tab in Chrome whenever you make changes in the Bubble Editor. No more manual refreshes â€” stay focused on building your app!

## Features

- **Automatic Reloads**: Detects updates and reloads the Preview tab.
- **Reload Options**: Choose between immediate reloads or reload upon tab focus.
- **Visual Indicator**: Adds a `*` to the tab title when an update is detected.
- **No Data Collection**: The extension does not collect or store any user data.

## Installation

Since this extension is in Beta, you need to manually install it in Chrome:

1. Download this repository by clicking on: `<> Code` --> `Download ZIP`.
2. Extract the ZIP file to some location in your computer.
2. Open Chrome and navigate to **chrome://extensions/**.
3. Enable **Developer mode** by toggling the switch in the upper-right corner.
4. Click **Load unpacked** and select the extracted folder.

## Settings

You can access the extension's Settings page by going into **Extensions** -> **Bubble Hot Reloader** -> **Menu** -> **Options**.

- By default, the extension reloads the Bubble Preview tab immediately after a change.
- If you check the "**Reload ONLY when I shift focus to the preview tab**" option, it will wait until you focus the tab before reloading, potentially reducing how often the page reloads.

**Note:** After changing any setting, manually reload the Preview tab once for the setting to take effect.
